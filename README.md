# discriminator
Consider the two-class pattern recognition problem in which the class conditional distributions are both normally distributed with arbitrary means M1 and M2, and covariance matrices 1 and 2 respectively. Assume that you are working in a 3-D space (for example, as in Assignment II) and that the covariance matrices are not equal. Here, you must assume that the means can be submitted as input parameters (and are not constant vectors) so that the classes can be made closer or more distant.
